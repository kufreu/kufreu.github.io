# reproducibility and replicability in geography 
In this lab we attempted to reproduce the work done by Malcomb, Weaver, and Krakowka in 2014 of modeling vunerablity in Malawi. In thier (2014) work they aimed to use a multi-indicator approach to analyze and assess climate vunerability using multi-level interviews from the [DHS Program](https://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS.cfm) and data from the [Global Risk Data Platform](https://preview.grid.unep.ch/).

As a class we drafted SQL code to analyze resiliency by Traditional Authority following the methods described by Malcomb and were only able to replicate 80% of Malcomb et al's analysis. The SQL code can be found [here](code&models/vulnerability.sql). QGIS with the GRASS plugin was used in this analysis.

Simply put, I was unable to reproduce the same results as was done in Malcomb et al's work and the litte information I have written here continues this cycle of irreproducibility. For this I apologize.
