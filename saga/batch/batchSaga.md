# batch scripting in saga
### about
I used batch processing for tools in SAGA in order to automate the channelization analysis done on Mount Kilimanjaro. ASTER global elevation models of the Andes Mountains east of Santiago were chosen as an alternative study region for this analysis. Both the batch file and the outputs of the script can be found at the bottom of this page. 
### script
