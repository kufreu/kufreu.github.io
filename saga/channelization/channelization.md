### channelization analysis of kilimanjaro
SAGA was used in this project to derive channel networks and other terrain products from global elevation models obtained from NASAâ€™s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Shown below are the steps taken to process the data. Zip files can also be found on this page. 

#### opening data in saga
![adding data](saga/channelization/images/addingData.png)
#### creating a mosaic using mosaicking tool and reprojecting in utm
![mosaic](saga/channelization/images/mosaic.PNG)
#### making a hillshade from mosaic for visualization
![hillshade](saga/channelization/images/hillshade.PNG)
#### finding sink routes in mosaic using sink drainage route dectection tool
![sink route](saga/channelization/images/sinkRoute.PNG)
##### close-up image

#### removing sinks from mosaic using sink removal tool

#### flow accumulation (top-down)

#### using flow accumulation to create a channel network
