### channelization analysis of kilimanjaro
SAGA was used in this project to derive channel networks and other terrain products from global elevation models obtained from NASAâ€™s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Shown below are the steps taken to process the data.

#### opening data in saga
![adding data](channelization/images/addingData.png)
#### creating a mosaic using mosaicking tool and reprojecting in utm

#### making a hillshade from mosaic for visualization

#### finding sink routes in mosaic using sink drainage route dectection tool

#### removing sinks from mosaic using sink removal tool

#### flow accumulation (top-down)
